# iRobot-Maze-runner
Mobile Robotic Project

A group project for Mobile Robotic class. An iRobot Create 2, a modified Roomba made for STEM purposes.
The main purpose of this project was to make our iRobot create 2 autonomous, so it can automatically traverse the maze using the sensors, camera, different algorithms. 


## Tools and technologies:

- iRobot Create 2 
- Arduino Uno
- Raspberry Pi 3
